# ubuntu script
- only works on X11 due to wctrl script being used
- [x] todo: recognize chrome browsers indepentently
- log: sudo tail -f /var/log/syslog | grep focus
- [ ] todo: window title gives errorneours behaviour, eg when image is opened in  vivaldi. use pid instead or other workaround
     - vivaldi issues fixes this (window name borked when open tab is an image)
     - todoist issues fixes this (window name inbox/now/etc in wmctrl)
